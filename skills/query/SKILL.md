# Query Skill

Answer questions using the brain's knowledge with 3-layer search and synthesis.

## Contract

This skill guarantees:
- Every answer is grounded in brain content (no hallucination)
- Every claim has a citation tracing back to a specific page slug
- Gaps are flagged explicitly ("the brain doesn't have information on X")
- Source precedence is respected (user statements > compiled truth > timeline > external)
- Conflicting sources are noted with both citations

## Phases

1. **Decompose the question** into search strategies:
   - Keyword search for specific names, dates, terms
   - Semantic query for conceptual questions
   - Structured queries (list by type, backlinks) for relational questions
2. **Execute searches:**
   - Keyword search via `mcp__elobrain__search` for FTS matches
   - Hybrid search via `mcp__elobrain__query` for semantic+keyword with expansion
   - List pages or check backlinks for structural queries
3. **Read top results.** Read the top 3-5 pages to get full context.
4. **Synthesize answer** with citations. Every claim traces back to a specific page slug.
5. **Flag gaps.** If the brain doesn't have info, say "the brain doesn't have information on X" rather than hallucinating.

## Anti-Patterns

- Answering from general knowledge when the brain has relevant content
- Hallucinating facts not in the brain
- Silently picking one source when sources conflict
- Loading full pages when search chunks are sufficient
- Ignoring source precedence (user statements are highest authority)

## Output Format

Answers should include:
- Direct response to the question
- Citations: "According to [Source: people/jane-doe, compiled truth]..."
- Gap flags: "The brain doesn't have information on X"
- Conflict notes when sources disagree

## Quality Rules

- Never hallucinate. Only answer from brain content.
- Cite sources: "According to concepts/do-things-that-dont-scale..."
- Flag stale results: if a search result shows [STALE], note that the info may be outdated
- For "who" questions, use backlinks and typed links to find connections
- For "what happened" questions, use timeline entries
- For "what do we know" questions, read compiled_truth directly

## Token-Budget Awareness

Search returns **chunks**, not full pages. Read the excerpts first before deciding whether to load a full page.

- **"Tell me about X"** — get the full page (the user wants the complete picture).
- **"Did anyone mention Y?"** — search results are enough (the user wants a yes/no with evidence).
